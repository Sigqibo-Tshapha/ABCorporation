The NumbersCompareTest class exercises the use of the equality(==) relational operator to check for equality among the 4 primitive integer objects,
particularly comparing num1 to num2 and num3 to num4. It makes use of reference comparison, meaning that we look at whether the references being compared 'point' to the same object
in our stack, as opposed to comparing their contents as you would with the equals() method. The output of the class is:
false
true


//I'm not sure how deep you want us to dissect this question but we can go further by explaining the datatypes used and how the JVM REALLY does the comparison
// and how the stack memory works but I don't think that's necessary
